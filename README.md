Activity 1: Simple-WebScraping
=============================

This activity consists in making a program in Python which manages to filter information on this [page](https://www.banggood.com/Flashdeals.html) through the Web Scraping technique, which consists of gathering information automatically from the Web.
In this case, we must obtain information about the products found on this website. Specifically, the information that we should obtain through this program was the name of the product, the price on offer and the original price of the product.
